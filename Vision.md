Vision


A digital experience platform that can serve a One Microsoft approach to Microsoft field and partners allowing us to create clarity and consistency of experience. It will enable us to generate energy and inspire optimism in our value proposition and help focus on our customer needs.

Digital experience platform is a story telling platform
Microsoftâ€™s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. With the right tools, anyone can do anything. Our mission is to create a digital experience that will deliver on our brand promise, differentiate Microsoft from our competition, show product truth that matters to our customers, support physical experiences and drive business growth. We focus bringing those principals to life with a Modern Workplace digital experience for Microsoft sellers and partners that will translate to value to every customer.


Our goal is to address business decision makers (BDM) looking for the reason why they need to adopt cloud, and the IT professionals (IT Pro) who seek to understand the what and how of executing a digital transformation strategy in partnership with Microsoft and learn the skills required to make this reality.



A digital experience can be delivered as a customer immersion experience, demo or lab. It allows people to get a view of our products from a presenter, facilitator or by getting hands-on.
