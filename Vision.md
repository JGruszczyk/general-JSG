A digital platform that allow us to create clarity and consistency of experience for our customers. It will enable us to generate energy and inspire optimism in our value proposition and help focus on our customer needs.

## Digital experience platform is a story telling platform
Microsoftâ€™s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. With the right tools, anyone can do anything. Our mission is to create a digital experience that will deliver on our brand promise, differentiate Microsoft, show product truth that matters to our customers, support physical experiences and help customers grow. We focus bringing those principals to life with a Modern Work digital experience for all that will translate to value to every customer.

Our goal is to address  decision makers looking for the reason why adopt cloud, and the IT professionals (IT Pro) who seek to understand the what and how of executing a digital transformation strategy in partnership with Microsoft and learn the skills required to make this reality.

A digital experience can be delivered as a customer immersion experience, demo or lab. It allows people to get a view of our products from a presenter, facilitator or by getting hands-on.
