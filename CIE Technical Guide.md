Facilitator guides can be obtained via an Experience card within the https://aka.ms/cdx. One is available per CIE and is specific to that experience. You are reading the technical guide.

Facilitator guides contain the CIE topic summary.

## Setup Time
When setting up the Customer Immersion Experience, you should start by obtaining a tenant (Virtual or Quick) at https://aka.ms or you may choose to create a Custom tenant with a specified domain name.  If you need a custom tenant and domain name, it is recommended that you start the process a week in advance of the CIE session.  All setup should be scheduled and completed well in advance of your first CIE session.
